# Chat w WebPage

> The World-Class AI Assistant for your Browser.

## Project Summary
Chat w WebPage is a privacy-first Chrome Extension that enables users to interface with any web page using state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs). It acts as a bridge between web content and AI reasoning, allowing for summarization, complex analysis, translation, and interactive dialogue without data leaving the user's local environment.

## Key Capabilities

### 1. Multi-Model Support (BYOK)
The extension implements a "Bring Your Own Key" architecture, supporting a vast array of providers:
- **Major Providers**: OpenAI (GPT-5.2, o1), Anthropic (Claude 4.5), Google (Gemini 3.0), DeepSeek (V3, Reasoner).
- **Aggregators**: OpenRouter, SiliconFlow, Grok.
- **Enterprise**: Azure OpenAI.
- **Local/Privacy**: Ollama, LM Studio (local inference support).

### 2. Privacy Architecture
- **Local-First**: API keys, conversation history, and user preferences are stored exclusively in the browser's IndexedDB.
- **Direct Connection**: API requests are dispatched directly from the client (browser) to the AI provider endpoint. No valid intermediate servers are used for data collection.

### 3. Advanced Reasoning Visualization
Features a specialized UI for Chain-of-Thought (CoT) models (e.g., OpenAI o1, DeepSeek R1), allowing users to visualize the step-by-step reasoning process alongside the final output.
